# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

This project was born from love and memories. We are committed to making participation in our project a harassment-free, welcoming experience for everyone, regardless of:

- Level of experience (beginners are especially welcome!)
- Age
- Body size
- Disability
- Ethnicity
- Nationality
- Personal appearance
- Race
- Religion
- Native language

## Our Standards

### Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- **Being welcoming** - Remember, someone contributing for the first time might be nervous
- **Being patient** - Not everyone has the same skill level or learns at the same pace
- **Being helpful** - Share your knowledge without condescension
- **Being respectful** - Disagreement is fine, disrespect is not
- **Being supportive** - Celebrate others' successes and help during struggles
- **Using inclusive language** - Avoid assumptions about others
- **Focusing on what is best for the community**
- **Showing empathy** - Remember there's a human behind every username

### Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Harassment of any kind
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without consent
- Inappropriate language or imagery
- Political arguments unrelated to the project
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Special Considerations

This project is deeply personal - it's a tribute to memory and friendship. Please be extra considerate when:

- Discussing the game's history
- Suggesting major changes
- Critiquing existing work

Remember: This isn't just code, it's someone's memories brought to life.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by:

1. Opening an issue with the label `code-of-conduct`
2. Contacting the project maintainer directly through GitHub

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

## Response Process

1. **Warning** - First violation will result in a warning
2. **Temporary Ban** - Second violation may result in temporary ban from interactions
3. **Permanent Ban** - Continued violations will result in permanent ban

## Remember

> "Some games live in our hearts forever..."

This project exists because of love for a game and memories with loved ones. Let's keep that spirit alive by being kind to each other.
