Destruction I version 1.00, Released 2001-04-29
 
  Only one minor bug was ever found in Destruction I so no 1.01 version was ever made.
  Destruction I became quite popular and got about 50,000 direct downloads. It was
  available on many cover and shareware cds which probably reached many more people
  than through direct downloads. The full version costed $10 and it allowed you to
  play an unlimited number of rounds (instead of 5), change the worldsize and start
  with money. The game didn't sell well at all, probably since it was too playable
  in it's unregistered form and because too little marketing efforts were made.
  The game was released under the name of ThorpeSoft which has been changed to 
  Nocturnal Development.

Destruction II
 
  Development began in the summer of 2001. It originally was meant to be finished
  by the end of that summer. It was completed 1½ years after the initial time frame.
  By the end of the next year's summer it began too look like something. A number
  of alpha versions were released to the licensed users during the fall. They didn't
  provide some features, like multiplayer, load/save possibility, proper statistics,
  special effects (scchhh, they're a secret) and some other things.
 
 Alpha versions

  Alpha 103.1, Released 2002-10-22
    A major bug which occured after having played one round caused the shop to be
    unusable. This called for a re-release the next day.
    
   The final Alpha contained some minor bugs but there were still lots of new
   features which needed implemented so after waiting a few days for bug reports
   work began on the first beta version.
