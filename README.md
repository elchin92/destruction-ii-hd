## 📖 A Personal Story & Game Preservation Mission

**Destruction II HD** is an open-source resurrection project dedicated to preserving and modernizing the legendary **turn-based tactical artillery tank game** created by Johan Torp (Nocturnal Development) during 2001-2003 and released January 20, 2003 (v1.00). This comprehensive DirectX 7 to SDL2 port brings classic scorched-earth style combat—featuring destructible terrain, physics-based projectiles, 45+ weapons, and local multiplayer—to Windows 10/11 with full x64 architecture support.

My cousin and I spent countless hours battling in this game during our youth (ages 10-15). It wasn't just a game for us—it was our tradition, our bonding ritual. Even as adults, every reunion meant firing up Destruction II, returning to those carefree times. The pixelated tanks, explosive terrain destruction, and simple yet deep mechanics were woven into the fabric of our friendship.

**But life is unpredictable. My cousin passed away...**

I can't bring him back, but I can resurrect our game and preserve those precious memories. Every line of code in this project is a tribute to our shared joy. This is why **Destruction II HD** exists—not just as a technical achievement, but as an act of love and remembrance.

## 🎮 About Destruction II

**Destruction II** is a legendary **turn-based tactical artillery tank game** developed by Johan Torp (Nocturnal Development) from summer 2001 to January 2003. Originally released as shareware on January 20, 2003 (v1.00), with source code later published as freeware on December 7, 2004, it captured the hearts of thousands of players worldwide, becoming a beloved classic in the **scorched earth** genre (similar to Worms, Pocket Tanks, and the original Scorched Earth).

### 🎯 Core Gameplay Features:
- **⚔️ Turn-based tactical combat** with **fully destructible terrain**
- **🔫 45+ weapons and items** including tanks, missiles, grenades, energy weapons, and power-ups
- **🤖 Multiple unit types**: Infantry Players, AI Clones, 5 Tank variants, 3 Droid types, 2 Machines, 2 Vehicles
- **👥 Local multiplayer (hot-seat)** for epic battles with friends
- **⚙️ Physics-based projectiles** with realistic ballistic trajectories
- **💥 Dynamic destructible environment** - every explosion permanently alters the battlefield
- **🎮 Solo campaign mode** with progressively challenging AI opponents
- **🛡️ Equipment customization** - armor, weapons, accessories

### 💡 Why This Resurrection Project?
- 🕹️ **Nostalgia** — For many of us, this game is cherished childhood memory
- 💻 **Inaccessibility** — Original doesn't work on modern Windows 10/11 (DirectX 7 incompatibility)
- 🎯 **Game Preservation** — Classic games deserve to survive technological obsolescence
- ❤️ **Personal Tribute** — This is more than code, these are precious memories
- 🆓 **Free Forever** — Honoring the original freeware spirit

### 📊 What Makes Destruction II Special?

Unlike many artillery games focused solely on multiplayer, Destruction II offers:
- **Rich single-player campaign** with story progression
- **Unique unit variety** beyond just tanks (droids, machines, infantry)
- **RPG elements** - collect money, buy equipment, upgrade units
- **Strategic depth** - terrain elevation affects shots, unit positioning matters
- **Retro aesthetic** with surprisingly deep mechanics

## 🤝 Who's Behind This Project?

I'm not a programmer. Not a game developer. Not an engineer.

**I'm just a person with memories and a dream.**

I've been using computers since I was 6 years old, but I've never written code professionally. This entire project is being created with the help of artificial intelligence:

- 🤖 **Claude 4.5 Sonnet** (Opus 4.1, Haiku 4.5) — my main assistant
- 💬 I just describe in plain language what needs to be done
- 🧠 AI transforms my words into working code
- ⚡ We work together when I have free time

**I'm not a "prompt engineer". I'm just someone who knows how to set tasks properly and has a dream.**
