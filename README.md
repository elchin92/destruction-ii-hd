### *"Some games live in our hearts forever..."*

## 📖 A Personal Story

My cousin and I absolutely loved this game when we were 10-15 years old. We spent endless hours battling each other, laughing at failed shots, and celebrating epic victories. Destruction II wasn't just a game for us — it was our tradition, our way of being together.

Even as we grew up, every time we met, we'd fire up this old game, returning to those carefree times. The pixelated tanks, destructible terrain, simple graphics — it was all part of our friendship.

**But life is unpredictable. My cousin is no longer with us...**

I can't bring him back to life, but I can bring our game and our memories back to life. Every line of code in this project is a tribute to those happy moments we shared together.

## 🎮 About This Project

**Destruction II** is a legendary turn-based tactical tank and artillery game created by Johan Torp (Nocturnal Development) in 2001-2003. Released as freeware, it captured the hearts of thousands of players worldwide.

### Why This Project Matters:

- 🕹️ **Nostalgia** — For many of us, this game is part of our childhood
- 💻 **Inaccessibility** — The game doesn't work on Windows 10/11
- 🎯 **Preserving Legacy** — Classic games shouldn't disappear
- ❤️ **Memory** — This is more than just code, these are memories

## 🤝 Who's Behind This Project?

I'm not a programmer. Not a game developer. Not an engineer.

**I'm just a person with memories and a dream.**

I've been using computers since I was 6 years old, but I've never written code professionally. This entire project is being created with the help of artificial intelligence:

- 🤖 **Claude 4.5 Sonnet** (Opus 4.1, Haiku 4.5) — my main assistant
- 💬 I just describe in plain language what needs to be done
- 🧠 AI transforms my words into working code
- ⚡ We work together when I have free time

**I'm not a "prompt engineer". I'm just someone who knows how to set tasks properly and has a dream.**
